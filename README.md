# LSTM Prediction Project

## Overview
This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict Stock Prices. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

### Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine, and ensure you have all the prerequisites installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Serendeep/Multivariate-Univariate-LSTM.git
cd Multivariate-Univariate-LSTM
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Notebook
Open the `Use_LSTM_to_prediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

```bash
jupyter notebook Use_LSTM_to_prediction.ipynb
```

Follow the instructions within the notebook to run the predictions.

## Dataset
Describe the dataset used in this project. Include details such as source, features, and any preprocessing steps.

## Model
